# FloristEcom Backend Project with NestJS

This is the backend project for Florist, an e-commerce platform specializing in flowers and related products. The project is built using the NestJS framework, a powerful and efficient framework for developing server-side applications with Node.js. Prisma is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and PostgreSQL is the database.

## Key Features
- **RESTful API:** The project provides RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend and other services.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.

- **Product Management:** Allows creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of flower products.

- **Logging and Error Handling:** Logs important activities and handles errors in a user-friendly manner.
